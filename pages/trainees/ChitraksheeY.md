project_title: ML-based simulation in reduced dimensions
project_goal: >
  Several examples exist that use generative adversarial networks (GANs) for faster simulation. However, a potential challenge in using them is computing time and the corresponding ML expertise. In this project, we aim to study faster ML-based simulation by using GANs along with dimensionality reduction algorithms on an individual workstation.
